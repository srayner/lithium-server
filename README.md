A manufacturing data capture solution. Track the progress of jobs as they
progress through manufacturing stages.

A simple Android application can be installed onto a tablet touch screen device.
This can be configured for a work center. The jobs for that work center are
displayed and the operative can indicate when a job is started and when it is
completed.

A back end web application provides managers with valuable information how much
time and resource each stage of production is taking, as well as the overall
progress.

An administration area allows production routes and work centers to be created.
As well as loading production schedules and jobs.
